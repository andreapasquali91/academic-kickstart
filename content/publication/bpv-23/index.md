We study alternating strand diagrams on the disk with an orbifold point. These are quotients by rotation of Postnikov diagrams on the disk, and we call them orbifold diagrams. We associate a quiver with potential to each orbifold diagram, in such a way that its Jacobian algebra and the one associated to the covering Postnikov diagram are related by a skew-group algebra construction. We moreover realise this Jacobian algebra as the endomorphism algebra of a certain explicit cluster-tilting object. This is similar to (and relies on) a result by Baur-King-Marsh for Postnikov diagrams on the disk.
