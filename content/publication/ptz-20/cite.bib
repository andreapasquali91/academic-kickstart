 abstract = {We investigate the existence of maximal collections of mutually noncrossing k-element subsets of \$\$\backslashleft\backslash\ 1, \backslashldots , n \backslashright\backslash\ \$\$1,łdots,nthat are invariant under adding \$\$k\backslashpmod n\$\$k(modn)to all indices. Our main result is that such a collection exists if and only if k is congruent to 0, 1 or \$\$-1\$\$-1modulo \$\$n/\\backslashtext \GCD\\(k,n)\$\$n/GCD(k,n). Moreover, we present some algebraic consequences of our result related to self-injective Jacobian algebras.},
