If $A$ and $B$ are $n$- and $m$-representation finite $k$-algebras, then their tensor product $\Lambda = A\otimes_k B$ is not in general 
$(n+m)$-representation finite. However, we prove that if $A$ and $B$ are acyclic and satisfy the weaker assumption of $n$- and $m$-completeness, then $\Lambda$ is $(n+m)$-complete.
This mirrors the fact that taking higher Auslander algebra does not preserve $d$-representation finiteness in general, but it does preserve $d$-completeness.
As a corollary, we get the necessary condition for $\Lambda$ to be $(n+m)$-representation finite which was found by Herschend and Iyama by using a certain twisted fractionally Calabi-Yau property.
