 abstract = {We study a finite-dimensional algebra $Łambda$ from a Postnikov diagram D in a disk, obtained from the dimer algebra of Baur-King-Marsh by factoring out the ideal generated by the boundary idempotent. Thus, $Łambda$ is isomorphic to the stable endomorphism algebra of a cluster tilting module T ∈CM(B) introduced by Jensen-King-Su in order to categorify the cluster algebra structure of ℂ[Grk(ℂn)]\$\backslashmathbb \C\[\backslashtext \Gr\_\k\(\backslashmathbb \C\̂n\)]\$. We show that $Łambda$ is self-injective if and only if D has a certain rotational symmetry. In this case, $Łambda$ is the Jacobian algebra of a self-injective quiver with potential, which implies that its truncated Jacobian algebras in the sense of Herschend-Iyama are 2-representation finite. We study cuts and mutations of such quivers with potential leading to some new 2-representation finite algebras.},
