We investigate how the higher almost split sequences over a tensor product of algebras are related to those over each factor.
  Herschend and Iyama give a criterion for when the tensor product of an $n$-representation finite algebra and an $m$-representation finite algebra is $(n+m)$-representation finite.
In this case we give a complete description of the higher almost split sequences over the tensor product by expressing every higher almost split sequence 
as the mapping cone of a suitable chain map and using a natural notion of tensor product for chain maps.
