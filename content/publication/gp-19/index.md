For a quiver with potential $(Q,W)$ with an action of a finite cyclic group $G$, we study the skew group algebra $\Lambda G$ of the Jacobian algebra $\Lambda = \mathcal P(Q, W)$. 
By a result of Reiten and Riedtmann, the quiver $Q_G$ of a basic algebra $\eta( \Lambda G) \eta$ Morita equivalent to $\Lambda G$ is known.
Under some assumptions on the action of $G$, 
we explicitly construct a potential $W_G$ on $Q_G$ such that $\eta(\Lambda G) \eta\cong \mathcal P(Q_G , W_G)$. The original quiver with potential can then be recovered by 
the skew group algebra construction with a natural action of the dual group of $G$. If $\Lambda$ is self-injective, then $\Lambda G$ is as well, and we investigate this case.
Motivated by Herschend and Iyama's characterisation of 2-representation finite algebras, we study how cuts on $(Q,W)$ behave with respect to our construction.
