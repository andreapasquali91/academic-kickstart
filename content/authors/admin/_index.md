I am a mathematician specialised in algebra. 

Here you can find more details about my [research]({{<ref "research">}}) as well as my [publications]({{<ref "publication">}}).

Currently I am working as a high school teacher in Longarone (Italy).

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Universit√§t Stuttgart](https://www.iaz.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html), in [Steffen Koenig](https://pnp.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/iaz/iaz1/Koenig/index.html)'s group, with a grant by the [Alexander von Humboldt foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html). 

In June 2019 I defended my [thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) at [Uppsala University](http://www.math.uu.se/?languageId=1). My advisor was [Martin Herschend](http://www2.math.uu.se/~martinh/).

You are welcome to [contact](/contact) me, preferably by [email](mailto:andrea.pasquali91@gmail.com).
