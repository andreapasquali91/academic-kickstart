I grew up in the town of Belluno in northeast Italy, where I was exposed to a lot of mountains. 

I did a bachelor in mathematics at the University of Padova, graduating in 2012. Then I enrolled in the [ALGANT](http://algant.eu/index.php) master program, within which I spent one more year in Padova and one year in Leiden in the Netherlands. 
In 2014 I started my Ph.D. in Uppsala (Sweden), with Martin Herschend as supervisor. I defended my [thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) in June 2019.

In 2019-2020 I was a postdoc in Stuttgart, in Steffen Koenig's group, with a grant by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation. 

In 2020 I (temporarily?) left academic research and moved back to Belluno, where I now work as a high school teacher.

During my bachelor and master I was a student of the [Galilean School of Higher Education](http://www.unipd-scuolagalileiana.it/en/content/galilean-school), the university's program for gifted students. This let me attend high-level courses in several non-math subjects.

My favourite team sport is [Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)), which I learned in Leiden and am still practicing (ask me about it!). My go-to individual physical activity is climbing.

My ideal holiday involves rock climbing, hiking or ski touring according to the season.

I like board games, both playing and designing them. I am generally good at the former and bad at the latter.
