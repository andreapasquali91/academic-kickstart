I grew up in the town of [Belluno](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Belluno) in northeast Italy, where I was exposed to a lot of mountains. 
[Here]({{< ref "mountains" >}}) you can read more about them. 

In 2008-09 I spent a year in [Aurillac](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurillac) in France, where I attended local high school and was hosted by a wonderful family. This was with one of [Intercultura-AFS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/AFS_Intercultural_Programs)'s programs. I then became a volunteer for the organisation, and was the head of the Belluno chapter from 2010 till when I left the country in 2013.

I did a bachelor in mathematics at the [University of Padova](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/), graduating in 2012. Then I enrolled in the [ALGANT](http://algant.eu/index.php) master program, within which I spent one more year in Padova and one year in [Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics) in the Netherlands. 
In 2014 I started my Ph.D. in [Uppsala](http://www.math.uu.se/?languageId=1) (Sweden), with [Martin Herschend](http://www2.math.uu.se/~martinh/) as supervisor. I defended my [thesis](/files/thesis.pdf) in June 2019.

In 2019-2020 I was a postdoc in Stuttgart, in [Steffen Koenig](https://pnp.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/iaz/iaz1/Koenig/index.html)'s group, with a grant by the [Alexander von Humboldt foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html). 

In 2020 I (temporarily?) left academic research and moved back to Belluno, where I now work as a high school teacher.

During my bachelor and master I was a student of the [Galilean School of Higher Education](http://www.unipd-scuolagalileiana.it/en/content/galilean-school), the university's program for gifted students. This let me attend high-level courses in several non-math subjects.

My favourite team sport is [Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)), which I practiced in Leiden and then discontinued. My go-to individual physical activity is [climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing).

My ideal holiday involves rock climbing, [hiking]({{< ref "mountains#summer" >}}) or [ski touring]({{< ref "mountains#winter" >}}) according to the season.

I like [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/), both playing and designing them. I am generally good at the former and bad at the latter. [Here]({{< ref "games" >}}) you can find a list of games I like.

I read quite a lot, both fiction and non-fiction. [Here]({{< ref "books" >}}) is a list of books.
