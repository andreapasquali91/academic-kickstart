I have done a lot of mountain hiking in my youth, thanks to my parents and friends. I still try to do as much as possible during the summer. I also enjoy mountain climbing, and have managed some of the (easiest) classic ascents in the Dolomites. 
Moreover, thanks to my father and my French host family, I have had the chance to do quite some ski touring in several regions of the Alps. 
If you want to talk mountains, I am usually happy to oblige.
