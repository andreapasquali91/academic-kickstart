#### Non-fiction
* N. Machiavelli, _The Prince_. 
The only book I read again immediately upon completion, so much I liked it.
* R. Dawkins, _The Selfish Gene_. 
This is the book that has had the most influence on the way I think, I think.
* J. Diamond, _Guns, Germs and Steel_. 
A popular history book full of insights and challenging theories.
* Y. N. Harari, _Sapiens_. 
What the ~~kids nowadays~~ younger generations read instead of Guns, Germs and Steel. The sequels are also recommended.
* B. Caplan, _The Case Against Education_.
A libertarian, but compelling, argument against the current (higher) education system.
* D. Kahneman, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_.
At the time, a breakthrough book on cognitive biases. Now a victim of the replication crisis.
* K. Simler, R. Hanson, _The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life_.
A humbling description of human behavioural patterns.
* N. N. Taleb, _Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life_.
An insightful "economics" book. Taleb does like to hear himself write.
* D. Graeber, _Debt: the First 5000 Years_.
Do you base your ideas about the rise of money and modern economy on Adam Smith? You are wrong, apparently.
* S. Dehaene, _Consciousness and the Brain_.
A good source for what we know about what consciousness is.
* J. Haidt, _The Righteous Mind_.
Morality from an anthropological perspective.
* S. Aaronson, _Quantum Computing since Democritus_.
A popular yet precise explanation of what to expect and not expect from quantum computers.


#### Fiction

* J. R. R. Tolkien, _The Silmarillion_.
A better creation epic than most religions have to offer, and a classic.
* P. Pullman, _His Dark Materials_ trilogy.
A young-adult humanist manifesto, beautifully written.
* M. Bulgakov, _Master and Margarita_.
A classic and a pleasure to reread.
* S. Rushdie, _The Satanic Verses_.
Powerful language for powerful themes (and yes it is also a classic).
* R. Jordan, _The Wheel of Time_ series.
My favourite fantasy epic. Recommended very strongly.
* J. K. Rowling, _Harry Potter_ series.
Probably a classic of the 21st century.
* S. Alexander, _Unsong_. 
This one is very hard to describe, but very easy to recommend.
* S. King, _The Dark Tower_ series.
Solid fantasy with a hero modeled on Sergio Leone characters.
* F. Dostoevskij, _The Brothers Karamazov_.
Extremely good, another classic.
* D. Adams, _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.
This set the bar for absurd humor way higher than we deserve.
