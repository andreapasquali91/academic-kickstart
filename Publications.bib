abstract="We investigate the existence of maximal collections of mutually noncrossing k-element subsets of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left{\backslash}{\{} 1, {\backslash}ldots , n {\backslash}right{\backslash}{\}} {\$}{\$}1,{\ldots},nthat are invariant under adding {\$}{\$}k{\backslash}pmod n{\$}{\$}k(modn)to all indices. Our main result is that such a collection exists if and only if k is congruent to 0, 1 or {\$}{\$}-1{\$}{\$}-1modulo {\$}{\$}n/{\{}{\backslash}text {\{}GCD{\}}{\}}(k,n){\$}{\$}n/GCD(k,n). Moreover, we present some algebraic consequences of our result related to self-injective Jacobian algebras.",

abstract="We study a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ from a Postnikov diagram D in a disk, obtained from the dimer algebra of Baur-King-Marsh by factoring out the ideal generated by the boundary idempotent. Thus, $\Lambda$ is isomorphic to the stable endomorphism algebra of a cluster tilting module T ∈CM(B) introduced by Jensen-King-Su in order to categorify the cluster algebra structure of ℂ[Grk(ℂn)]{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}C{\}}[{\backslash}text {\{}Gr{\}}{\_}{\{}k{\}}({\backslash}mathbb {\{}C{\}}^{\{}n{\}})]{\$}. We show that $\Lambda$ is self-injective if and only if D has a certain rotational symmetry. In this case, $\Lambda$ is the Jacobian algebra of a self-injective quiver with potential, which implies that its truncated Jacobian algebras in the sense of Herschend-Iyama are 2-representation finite. We study cuts and mutations of such quivers with potential leading to some new 2-representation finite algebras.",

abstract = "If A and B are n- and m-representation finite k-algebras, then their tensor product Λ=A⊗kB is not in general (n+m)-representation finite. However, we prove that if A and B are acyclic and satisfy the weaker assumption of n- and m-completeness, then Λ is (n+m)-complete. This mirrors the fact that taking higher Auslander algebra does not preserve d-representation finiteness in general, but it does preserve d-completeness. As a corollary, we get the necessary condition for Λ to be (n+m)-representation finite which was found by Herschend and Iyama by using a certain twisted fractionally Calabi–Yau property."

abstract = "We investigate how the higher almost split sequences over a tensor product of algebras are related to those over each factor. Herschend and Iyama give in [6] a criterion for when the tensor product of an n-representation finite algebra and an m-representation finite algebra is (n+m)-representation finite. In this case we give a complete description of the higher almost split sequences over the tensor product by expressing every higher almost split sequence as the mapping cone of a suitable chain map and using a natural notion of tensor product for chain maps."
